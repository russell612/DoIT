# DoIT: A To-Do List Randomizer
## A group project created by Full Stop

Have you ever had the thought of having too much to do and so you do nothing due to the sheer stress of thinking about it?<br/>

Well do we have a solution for you (kinda)
### Introduction
A small group project by a bunch of students from Monash University for an internal hackathon with the theme of digitilization of our daily life.
Our goal is to reduce the stress and burnout of everyday life, especially in the pandemic, through a step-by-step approach towards handling our day-to-day routine. <br/><br>
Once the hackathon is finished, the app will be feature complete with a basic GUI. The main feature of our app is to randomize stored tasks. Data is stored in a text file in the app folder using Pickle.

### Feature Set

#### Demo
Users can input their task of choice into the text field above. Then after that by either pressing 'Add' or the enter key, the task will be stored into the task list which is the menu above. <br><br>
Users are allowed to then edit the task that they have entered or delete them entirely. After all the tasks are inputed the user can generate a random task to do by pressing on the 'Randomize Task' button. After that is done the user is unable to randomize again until they have finished the task. A popup will prompt the user the finish the current task at hand. When users complete the task by pressing 'Completed Task', the task will be removed automatically from the list, and users are then allowed to randomize the next task.


### Future Implementations

<p align= 'center'>Potential Look of DoIT Social Platform</p> <br>

If the project wins or gains traction, future projects include creating a social platform based on the app where you could compete with your friends or people around you on whoever finishes the most tasks in a given timeframe. This will spur motivation among people to do their tasks in a healthy, competitive way. Stay tuned for updates. <br>
