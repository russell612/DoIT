# To-Do List Randomizer
## A group project created by Russell, Ryan, Jian Hong and Jing Kai

Have you ever had the thought of having too much to do and so you do nothing due to the sheer stress of thinking about it?<br/>

Well do we have a solution for you (kinda)
### Introduction
A small group project by a bunch of University Students from Monash for an internal Hackathon with the theme of digitilization of our daily tasks.
Our goal is to reduce the stress and burnout of everyday life, especially in the pandemic, through a step-by-step approach towards handling our day-to-day routine. <br/>
Once the hackathon is finished the app will technically be feature complete with a basic GUI with the the main feature of randomizing stored tasks complete.

### Future Implementations
If the project wins or gains traction, future implementation includes creating a social platform based on the project where you could compete with your friends or people around you on whoever finishes the most tasks in a given timeframe. This will spur motivation among people to do their tasks in a healthy, competitive way. Stay tuned on this space <br>

### Build Status
Currently we have not started to code. Stay tuned for updates.
